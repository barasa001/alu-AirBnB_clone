<h1 align="center">THE AIRBNB PROJECT.</h1>
This is the first project of the AirBnB.

This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects.

**Overview**
  
We will be covering the following areas;
    1.put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
    2.create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
    3.create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
    4.create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
    5.create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
