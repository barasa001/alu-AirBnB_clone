<h1 align="center">THE AIRBNB PROJECT.</h1>
This is the first project of the AirBnB.

This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects.

**Classes**
We are going to create a number of classes.

The first class which is the parent class is the **BaseModel Class** .

We will the create other classes that inherit common attributes from this class and their own attributes.

The classes that we will create together with their methods and attributes include; 

    1. User
    
          Attributes specific to it;
        
            ✹email             ✹first_name            
            ✹password          ✹last_name
                       
            
     2. Amenity
     
          Attribute specific;
         
             ✹name
             
      3. Place
      
          Specific attributes;
